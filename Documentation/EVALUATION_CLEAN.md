# Evaluation (Clean Summary)

This is a cleaned, human-readable summary of the automated evaluation run. Visual charts were skipped in the headless export because plotting libraries (e.g. `matplotlib`) were not available in the environment. To reproduce full charts, install `matplotlib` and re-run the notebook interactively.

## FAISS Index Benchmark Results (Summary)

```
FAISS INDEX BENCHMARK RESULTS
Index Type      Build Time   Single Query    Batch Query     Throughput
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flat                  0.02s          1.07ms          0.09ms    11095.2 QPS
IVF                   0.11s          0.20ms          0.04ms    24369.9 QPS
HNSW                  0.50s          0.20ms          0.04ms    24992.9 QPS
```

- Notes:
  - Benchmarks were run on synthetic 512-dim embeddings to simulate CLIP/ViT vectors for ~13k items.
  - HNSW and IVF show large throughput advantages vs Flat; HNSW gives the best throughput in this run.

## Key Takeaways

- TF-IDF and simple baselines are useful initial baselines before adding multimodal signals.
- FAISS (HNSW) enables sub-millisecond average query latency and very high QPS for large catalogs.
- Headless exports may skip visualizations if plotting libs are missing; install `matplotlib` and `seaborn` in the project's venv to produce the charts.

## Next Steps

- (Optional) Re-run the notebook interactively with plotting packages installed to regenerate full plots.
- (Optional) Replace `Documentation/EVALUATION.md` with this cleaned version, or keep both for traceability.
